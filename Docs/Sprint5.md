  This sprint, we completed:
  
  * will make sure there is unit testing and mock testing for all of the code.
  * make the Graphic User Interface more user-friendly.
  * Make all the documentation organized and add testing.md and projectreflections.md files. 



  ## Retro
  
  
  
  ### Pros
  
  * We were able to assign tasks equally among the group members.
  
  ### Cons
  
  * We do not have anything else to add, so we had to pay attention to the effort spent on the remainning tasks.
