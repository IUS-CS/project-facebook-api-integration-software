# Howto Use FreeAdmin

When the Free Admin software window appears, there should be 3 drop down menus along the top labelled "File", "View", and "Help". There should be 3 text input boxes in the window; "Enter Access Token", "Every how many hours?", and "Every how many minutes". There should also be 6 buttons in the window; "Select Pictures", "Select Videos (.mp4)", "Select Text File", "Post Pictures", "Post Videos", and "Post Status".
