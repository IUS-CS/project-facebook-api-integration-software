# Testing

### Unit Testing

We are using Maven to run our unit tests.  The Mockito framework will be used for mock testing of the 
Free Admin software.  A mock object of the Facebook API will be created to show that the software is
working correctly internally.

### Manual Testing

Manual testing will need to be done for interacting with Facebook.  There are three different types of files
a client can use to post to Facebook; text files, image files, and video files.  Each of these file types 
will be manually tested to make sure the posts display on the user's Facebook page correctly.
