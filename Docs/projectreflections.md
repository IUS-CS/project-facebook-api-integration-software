During this project, I have gained more experience with git commands. I also became more comfortable working on a project
with a team and keep track of the code in a proper timing. The tasks I accomplished in this project of course 
with the effort of my team members include: software planning, analyzing and designing which include:
the buttons and their functionalities, the initial graphical user interface, and implemented code for each component.
I have also added unit test for the software main window before we added our methods.
I participated to write the required documents that describe our software.

My experience with this project has been good.  I have learned how to use Git and Github when working on a project as a
team.  I have primarily reviewed code and proofread documents that my teammates have developed.  I created our team
testing.md document, and I am working on completing the unit testing and mock testing for our code.
