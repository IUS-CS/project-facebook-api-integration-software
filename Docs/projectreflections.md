 ## John Combs

While I've used Git/GitHub in the past, this is the first time I've used it to collaborate on a project. I knew branches
existed but I never knew how they were really useful. I now use them on my private repos for implementing features. I wish
we were able to meet in person so that the project would have moved along more smoothly but being online-only actually
probably helped us get the most use out of GitHub for organization. In this project, I added some features that helped
the program run more efficiently and added a couple additional dialogs to the GUI.

### Introduction
I initially thought the C346 group project was to be yet another computer science programming collaboration when I first began. Looking back now, I can proudly say that I have learned more than just programming. I have received an impressive lesson and practiced on source control or source code management (SCM), learned a new way to document using Markdown, and applied many aspects of software engineering theories to the group project.

### My Journey with Source Control
I have used Github for other courses previously, and I thought I was taking good advantages of useful cloud storage as a repository. I also have a faint idea about Git. Honestly, I did not understand the application of SCM in a software engineering environment. Well, my C346 experience has shown that I could not be more wrong about Github and Git in the past.

Because every student is required to use Git and Github for C346, I have just begun to realize the true powers of Git and Github. I have also realized the Git can live beyond online platforms such as Github or Gitlab. Git can be hosted very conveniently and residing on the LAN, or localhost. Git, along with Github or any other compatible SCM platform, are productivity multipliers.  In addition, I have learned to use Github correctly for project management and SCM. I can now confidently announce that I am a true believer of SCM, and I cannot imagine starting any projects without it.

### Using Markdown beyond Readme
I have use Markdown occasionally to compose Readme files in the past sing only the basic syntax in conjunction with Github. I never took full advantages of the simple and easy-to-use markup language as I never imagined using it to format virtually any document.

Because C346 expects the students to use Markdown to annotate the documentations, I started to use Markdown more and began to appreciate the lightweight markup language with seemingly unlimited potential. I have learned to create table of contents (TOC), tables, autolinks, and task lists.

### Learning and Applying Software Engineering Theories 
In C346, the students have learned theories of agile development, testing, design patterns, and a few other course topics. I find our project team was able to learned, adapt, utilize, and benefit from at least half the course topics. Although this project may not materialize as the next killer application, I believe every member of the project team has all learned a valuable lesson on Software Engineering, and we will all grow one way or another, even if any of us do not become a software engineer.

 ## Mustafa Nafia

During this project, I have gained more experience with git commands. I also became more comfortable working on a project
with a team and keep track of the code in a proper timing. The tasks I accomplished in this project of course
with the effort of my team members include: software planning, analyzing and designing which include:
the buttons and their functionalities, the initial graphical user interface, and implemented code for each component.
I have also added unit test for the software main window before we added our methods.
I participated to write the required documents that describe our software.

 ## James Schlesener

I had used Github in the past for individual assignments, but this was the first time I used it for a group project.  Using
Git and Github on this project really helped me understand how it all works when working collaboratively.  It was a very
valuable learning experience and really helped our team get the work done on our project while working in a completely remote
environment.  I also learned how to work on a project as a team using sprints which I had never done before.  I created
our team testing.md document and worked on completing unit and mock testing for our code.  I was unfamiliar with mock testing
before this project and was able to learn how Mockito works to create mock objects for unit testing.  I did struggle some
with the mock testing, but in the process, I learned a lot more about debugging tools and feel like I have a better understanding
of how mocks and testing all work.
