  Points | Story
  -------|--------
    2    | As a client, I want to be able to make a post at certain hour and minutes.
    2    | As a client, I want the interface to be simpler by removing the exit button and fixing the resolution.
    2    | As a developer, I will add testing.md file that describes how the software is being tested. 
    3    | As a developer, I will implement a queue for posting features.
