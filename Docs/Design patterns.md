# 1. Design Patterns that we implemented:

* Singleton Pattern: We have created one instance of the GUI class to have the main frame that contains each of our software features.

* Adapter Pattern: We used the adapter pattern to make access the objects in the main frame class
  by creating the "Post" class to make classes work together to avoid deprecated code or incompatible interfaces. 

# 2. Design patterns we may implement:

* Iterator Pattern
* Strategy Pattern

# 3. How we plan to implement it

* We may implement the Iterator pattern by adding a feature that will access contents without any changes to internal structure.
* We may implement the strategy pattern by adding a calendar feature and set each column and row with an algorithm
  that will be encapsulated to work independently.
