# How to Create a Facebook App and Generate App Access Token(s)

1. Before you get started, you must register as a Facebook developer at https://developers.facebook.com/ and click "Get started" at the top right corner of the page.
2. If you have never created apps on the Facebook platform before, you'll need to create an app in order to use the Graph API Explorer feature.
3. In our example, we'll create an app ID and select "For Everything Else" to describe our app.
4. You'll need to specify an app display name, provide an app contact email, and connect a Business Manager account if applicable.
5. Complete a security check by passing a reCAPCHA challenge.
6. Navigate to Facebook Graph API Explorer at https://developers.facebook.com/tool as/explorer/
7. You will be prompted to register as a Facebook developer if you have not done so already. If you are in fact registered, double check if you're logged in and your Facebook account has already been verified though SMS or voice.
