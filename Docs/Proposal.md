# Description

*A multi-platform program called Free Admin.  <br><br/>
The program will intergrate the Facebook platform API to create features <br><br/>
such as schedule and publish multiple posts. Since Facebook does not provide a  <br><br/>
multiple-post scheduler currently, the idea is to use the Facebook platform access  <br><br/>
tokens to schedule posts or files to be published.  <br><br/>
Free Admin works by scheduling multiple posts to be published on a certain page.  <br><br/>
It will connect to the Facebook platform server and automatically publish the  <br><br/>
desired post. The required platform access tokens and the required resource are  <br><br/>
available at the Facebook developer portal.*
