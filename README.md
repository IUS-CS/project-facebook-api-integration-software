# f20-project-facebook-api-integration-software

The **Facebook-api-integration-software project** plans to produce a multi-platform software program named Free Admin. Free Admin will be developed in the Java SE programing language, and it will be an open source project with the MIT license. The intent is to develop the ability to schedule and publish multiple posts by integrating the Facebook platform API. Because Facebook does not provide a multiple-post scheduler currently, the idea is to use the Facebook platform access tokens to schedule posts or files to be published. This program has real-world application value since many organizations hire employees just to advertise their products on social media pages.

Free Admin works by scheduling multiple posts to be published on a certain page.
It will connect to the Facebook platform server and automatically publish the desired posts or files. The required platform access tokens and the required resource are available on the Facebook developer portal site.
